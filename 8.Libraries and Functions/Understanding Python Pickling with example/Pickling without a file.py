Advantages of using Pickle Module:

Recursive objects (objects containing references to themselves): 
Pickle keeps track of the objects it has already serialized, 
so later references to the same object wonâ€™t be serialized again. 
(The marshal module breaks for this.)

Object sharing (references to the same object in different places): 
This is similar to self- referencing objects; pickle stores the object once, 
and ensures that all other references point to the master copy. 
Shared objects remain shared, which can be very important for mutable objects.

User-defined classes and their instances: 
Marshal does not support these at all, but pickle can save and 
restore class instances transparently. The class definition must be importable and 
live in the same module as when the object was stored.
