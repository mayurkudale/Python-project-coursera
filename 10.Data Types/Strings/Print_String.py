# A python program to illustrate slicing in strings

x = "Geeks at work"

# Prints 3rd character beginning from 0
print (x[2])

# Prints 7th character
print (x[6] )

# Prints 3rd character from rear beginning from -1
print (x[-3] )

# Length of string is 10 so it is out of bound
#print (x[15] ) #error
